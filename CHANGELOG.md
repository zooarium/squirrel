## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `internal/policy.Can()`: RBAC Tier 1 enforcement (coarse CRUD + sudo bypass), consuming the policy cache below. Checks a sudo bypass first (global, or tenant-scoped via the assignment's `app_id`), then falls back to a coarse resource/action permission match, unioned across all of a user's roles. Field/ownership checks are deferred to Tier 2/3 (steps 7.2/7.3) — not yet wired into any entity handler.
- `internal/policy`: Tier 1 (coarse CRUD) authorization cache — pulls falcon's role->permission export (`GET /services/{id}/permissions/map` on falcon's `internal-s2s` listener), compiles it into `map[roleName]RolePolicy`, and serves it from an in-memory TTL cache (`CACHE.POLICY_TTL`, default 60s), refreshing lazily on read past expiry. New `FALCON.SERVICE_ID` config, set to `2` — squirrel's fixed id in falcon's `fal_service` table, seeded by falcon's `20260729092300_seed_fal_service` migration (identical across all envs) — and `FALCON.BASE_URL`/`TIMEOUT`. Warmed eagerly at startup (non-fatal on failure); fails closed (empty map) if falcon is unreachable past the TTL. Enforcement (checking a request against this map) is a separate step.

### Changed
- `internal/db/client.go` SQLite DSN: enabled WAL journal mode and 5s busy timeout (`_journal_mode=WAL&_busy_timeout=5000`) for better write concurrency.
- Re-vendored `keeper/pkg/auth`: `RoleUser` renamed to `RoleAdmin` upstream (value unchanged, `0`). No caller changes needed in squirrel.
- Re-vendored `keeper/pkg/auth`: `UserClaims.Roles` changed type from `[]string` to `[]RoleAssignment` (name + falcon `service_id`/`app_id` scope) — needed so `Can()`'s sudo tenant-scope check has per-assignment scope at request time. No caller changes needed in squirrel (nothing here read `claims.Roles` yet).

## [0.0.3] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- `docker-compose.yml`: `mem_limit`/`cpus` caps and `json-file` log rotation (max-size 10m, max-file 3) on the `api` service.
- `logrotate.conf`: host-level rotation for the bind-mounted `./log/*.log` files (daily, 7 rotations, copytruncate).
- `docs/LOGGING.md`: logging setup and rotation reference.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_USING_DOCKER.md`: Docker-based production setup guide.
- Request ID middleware (`internal/platform/http/requestlog.go`): `chi/middleware.RequestID` first in the chain on primary and secondary routers, structured JSON request-completion log (method/path/status/duration/remote addr) replacing chi's plain-text logger, `X-Request-Id` echoed on every response.
- `GET /ready`: DB-ping readiness check (`internal/db/client.go` `Ping`), separate from the pure-liveness `GET /health`; 503 on unreachable DB. Registered on primary and secondary listeners.
- `make backup` / `make restore`: online-safe SQLite `.backup` to `data/backups/` (14-day retention) and manual restore from a backup file. Documented in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_USING_DOCKER.md`.
- Outbound HTTP clients (impersonation-revocation) now use vendored `keeper/pkg/httpclient` (retry + circuit breaker) instead of a hand-rolled `&http.Client{}`; fail-open/fail-closed policy per call site unchanged.
- `internal/audit`: Ent client-level mutation hook logging one JSON line per create/update/delete to a dedicated `log/audit.log` (separate from `api.log`) — actor/app/division from JWT claims + mutation, no DB table. `make audit-logs` to tail it.

### Changed
- Stats cache in `cmd/api/main.go` now uses vendored `keeper/pkg/cache` instead of `squirrel/pkg/cache`. Behavior unchanged.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` moved to `docs/DEPLOYMENT_WITHOUT_DOCKER.md` (bare-binary + systemd path), alongside the new Docker path doc.

### Removed
- `pkg/cache` (duplicate TTL cache, superseded by vendored `keeper/pkg/cache`).
